I am indebted to:
- RailsConf for giving me the opportunity to make the kind of tutorial I wish had been around when I was learning to program
- The team at [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/) for showing me what a kind, inclusive programming tutorial looks like
- [Matthew Boeh](http://steppedpyramids.com/) for teaching me pretty much everything I know about Ruby and making software work good
- Amy Hanlon, Lacey Williams Henschel, Tara Planas, and Will Clifford for testing out a messy first draft of this tutorial
- [Nate Smith](http://tilde.town/~vilmibm/) for spending many nights making me dinner and listening to me read this tutorial aloud
