That's it! You now have the power to use any API to make any weird thing you want. May all of your GET and POST dreams come true.

Some extra challenges you might want to try:
- Redirect back to the index after clicking the post tweet button
- Include some of the text or images from the Wikipedia article in the horoscope message
- Include the link to the Wikipedia article your horoscope comes from in your tweet
- Put your application out into the world for everyone to see using a deployment platform such as [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
- Let people log in to Twitter so horoscope tweets are sent to their personal account
